    Invoke the subcommand without a candidate to see a comprehensive list of all
    candidates with name, URL, detailed description and an installation command.
    If the candidate qualifier is specified, the subcommand will display a list
    of all available and local versions for that candidate. In addition, the
    version list view marks all versions that are local, installed or currently
    in use. They appear as follows:

    [3m+ - local version
    * - installed
    > - currently in use[0m

    Java has a custom list view with vendor-specific details.
