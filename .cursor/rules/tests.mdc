# Testing Standards

## Core Principles
- Test behaviour, not implementation.
- Prefer unit tests over integration tests
- Reserve integration tests for testing generalised behaviours
- Mock external dependencies only, at the lowest level (e.g. database operations, API calls, etc).
- Prioritise clarity and readability.

## Test Cases
- **Happy Path**: Each test should begin with the simplest success case
- **Error Cases**: Multiple unhappy path cases should follow to test all the edge cases

## Best Practices
- **Organisation**: Each command (like `version`, `current`, `help` etc.) should have its unit tests inside the command file. Integration tests should live under the `test/` directory and adopt the name of the command they are testing (test/version.rs is responsible for testing the `version` command).
- **Naming**: Use descriptive test names (e.g. `should_operation_scenario_expected`).
- **Fixtures**: Use fixtures for common test data and mocks.
  - When using text fixtures, be extremely precise about newlines:
    - Check for newlines at the start of the file
    - Check for newlines at the end (sometimes multiple are needed)
    - Preserve exact line wrapping and formatting
- **Assertions**: Only a single assertion per test which asserts the test description.
